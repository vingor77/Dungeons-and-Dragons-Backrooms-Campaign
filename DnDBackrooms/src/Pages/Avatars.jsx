They were as close as family, but that all changed after humans first entered The Backrooms. These siblings had reigned as gods over the humans, until they were overthrown and their alliance was fractured. Today, many of the "gods" are corrupted, dead or isolated, but they may soon be reunited against a force which threatens their entire home, and all its inhabitants alike.</Typography>

At the center of its narrative are siblings whose relationships with each-other transcend time and space. Although this story may be one of Gods, there is an undeniably human element to it. Its themes are of legacy, purpose, betrayal, heartbreak, reconciliation, and more.</Typography>
